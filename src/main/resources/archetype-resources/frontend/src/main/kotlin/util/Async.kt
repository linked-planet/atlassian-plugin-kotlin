 * Utility that can be used to asynchronously send HTTP requests, while only
 * executing callbacks on success for the latest request of that type.
 *
 * Consider a dropdown that causes an HTTP request to be sent on selection
 * change. If the user changes the selection in quick succession, multiple
 * HTTP requests will be in flight. The responses for these requests are
 * not guaranteed to arrive in order. But to be consistent, the UI must
 * only update in accordance with the latest selection. Thus, the `complete`
 * function takes care of discarding success responses of obsolete requests.
